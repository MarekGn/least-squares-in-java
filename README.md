=====================

Java Least Squares fitting library.

This is a small least squares fitting library made in java.
It was originally used in the development of an image analysis tool 
SpeckleTrackerJ. Which has a lot of functions, this is a smaller package that
only does the least squares portion. It is being written to include tests
and a few more features.

SpeckleTrackerJ can be found at:

and the source code is hosted at google code.
